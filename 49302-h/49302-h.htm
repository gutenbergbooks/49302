a stand.</p>

<p>The white species comprises a very large percentage of the
present acreage of sweet clover.</p>

<p>Annual yellow sweet clover should be sown in no portion
of the United States except the South and Southwest, and then
only as a cover of green-manure crop.</p>

<p>Sweet clover is being cultivated in practically every State
in the Union. At the present time the largest acreage is found
in The western North-Central States and in the Mountain
States.</p>

<p>Sweet clover is adapted to a wider range of climatic conditions
than any of the true clovers, and possibly alfalfa.</p>

<p>Sweet clover will grow on practically all soil types to be
found in this country, provided the soil is not acid and is well
inoculated.</p>

<p>Sweet clover is more drought resistant than alfalfa or red
clover. It is quite resistant to alkali.</p>

<p>The lime requirement of sweet clover is as high as that of
red clover or alfalfa. Maximum growth is obtained only on
soils that are not acid.</p>

<p>Sweet clover usually will respond to applications of fertilizers
and manure.</p>

<p>In the move humid sections of the country good stands
usually are obtained by seeding with a nurse crop.</p>

<p>Only seed which germinates 75 per cent or more should be
sown in the spring of the year unless the rate of seeding is
increased to make up for poor germination.</p>

<p>Sweet clover does best when seeded on a well-firmed seed
bed which has only sufficient loose soil on the surface to
cover the seed.</p>

<p>It is very essential that inoculation be provided in some
form if success is to be expected.</p>

<p>The large number of failures in obtaining a stand of sweet
clover are due primarily to acid soils, lack of inoculation, and
seed which germinates poorly.</p>

<p>Spring seedings in general are satisfactory, but in the South
excellent stands are obtained from midwinter seedings also
Fall seedings are usually successful south of the latitude of
southern Ohio.</p>

<p>Sweet clover is an important forage crop in many regions. Although
one of the oldest of known plants, not until very recently has
it been considered seriously as a forage plant in this country. The
principal causes for not utilizing this crop were its aggressiveness on
uncultivated land in many localities, the tendency of the stems to
become woody as they mature, and the refusal of stock to eat sweet
clover before they had become accustomed to the bitter taste. Another
reason was the fact that until recently red clover could be
grown in the eastern half of the United States without difficulty. In
northern Kentucky the continuous growing of tobacco or of tobacco
and wheat impoverished the soil to such an extent that crops no
longer could be grown successfully. Upon the abandoned farms in
this section sweet clover was introduced as a honey plant. Owing
to the remarkable yields of tobacco that were obtained on such farms
after sweet clover had been grown for a few years the acreage of
this plant increased very rapidly. For a number of years sweet
clover has been grown on the Selma chalk (rotten-limestone) soils of
Alabama and Mississippi as a soil-improving crop. At the present
time it is being cultivated in practically every State, and the acreage
is increasing very rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span></p>

<p>After it had been demonstrated that sweet clover would grow
successfully on soils too depleted for other crops, many experiments
were conducted to determine its value as forage. It was found
that it was not only a valuable soil-improving crop, but that it
made an excellent pasture and hay plant, quite palatable and rich
in protein.</p>

<p>White sweet clover comprises a very large percentage of the acreage
seeded to sweet clover at the present time. On this account this species
ordinarily is referred to simply as "sweat clover." The yellow
biennial species is designated as yellow sweet clover, and the annual
yellow species as bitter clover, sour clover, or annual yellow sweet
clover. This usage has been adopted in this bulletin.</p>

sweet clover; 2, biennial yellow sweet clover; 3, annual yellow sweet clover, or sour
clover; 4, alfalfa. The small figures in each drawing show the natural size of the
seed. The venation and shape of the seed pods are important characters in distinguishing
the different species of sweet clover.</span>
</div>

<p>The cultivation of sweet clover should be preceded by a thorough
understanding of the requirements for obtaining a stand. It can not
be grown successfully on all soils, as many assume from seeing it
growing in uncultivated places. Neither will it thrive in many sections
of the country without careful preparation of the seed bed.
Sweet clover will not grow successfully in acid soils unless lime is
applied, but it will make a good growth in soils too low in humus to
grow red clover, provided the soil is neutral or alkaline.</p>

<p>Sweet clover is an excellent plant to precede alfalfa, as the large
roots do much toward breaking up and aerating the subsoil. Contrary
to the belief of many, it will not inoculate the soil for alfalfa
unless inoculation is applied to the sweet clover. If, however, the
soil contains but few inoculating germs, the sweet clover will serve
as a medium to inoculate it thoroughly.</p>

<p>A number of species of sweet clover are found throughout the
world, and most of them are native to temperate Europe and Asia
as far east as Tibet,</p>

<p>It is difficult for the average person to distinguish between the
different species of sweet clover from an examination of the seeds or
seed pods only. The differences are indicated in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>. Where
there is a question as to the identity of
a sample of seed it should be sent to a
State agricultural experiment station
or to one of the seed laboratories of the
United States Department of Agriculture
for identification.</p>

<p>White sweet clover (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) is ordinarily
referred to as melilotus or meliot
in the South and merely as sweet clover
in other portions of the country. When
soil conditions are favorable for germination,
sweet-clover seedlings will appear
from one to two weeks after seeding.
On account of the biennial nature
of the plants, they do not seem to make
much growth above ground the first
month or six weeks after germination,
but during this time they are developing
root systems rapidly and thus becoming
established, so to be able to
withstand adverse conditions. Plants
which have made no more than 2 inches
of top growth very often have produced
roots 6 inches or more in length
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). The tap-root continues to develop
rapidly throughout the growing
season the first year, and by autumn
often reaches a length of 24 to 36 inches
and a diameter of three-fourths to 1
inch at the crown.</p>

<p>After the root system becomes established
the plants produce an upright,
branching, leafy growth, which under ideal growing conditions may
reach a height of 48 inches the first season, but more often 18 to 30
inches. A large quantity of reserve food is stored in the tap-root the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
first season; this reserve food enables the plants to make a rapid and
vigorous growth early the following spring.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 503px;">
<a id="fig3" name="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="503" height="596" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;White sweet-clover plants collected from a plat six weeks from the date of
seeding. An extensive root system such as is shown here is often developed before
much growth is made above ground.</span>
</div>

<p>Toward the end of the growing season of the first year a number
of buds, which serve to produce the second year's growth (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), are
formed on the crowns of the plants. After these buds are formed
the plants may be clipped quite close to the ground, as the buds are
not developed until the plants have made sufficient growth to live
through the winter.</p>

<p>During the second season sweet clover makes a rapid, erect,
stemmy, branching growth from 5 to 10 feet in height, the plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
producing only a moderate number of leaves, which drop as the seed
matures. A large number of loose racemes bearing white flowers
(see <a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) are produced during the flowering period, which usually
lasts from three to five weeks.</p>

<p>Before sweet clover has made a growth of 12 to 18 inches it closely
resembles alfalfa. The plants may be distinguished from alfalfa by
the absence of pubescence on the under side of the leaves and by
their bitter taste. When they are in bloom they may be identified
easily by their long, loose racemes of white flowers and their open,
coarse growth. Unlike alfalfa, the seeds are ordinarily found singly
in the pods. Two seeds
may occasionally be
found, and very rarely
three, in a single pod.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="STRAINS_OF_WHITE_SWEET_CLOVER" name="STRAINS_OF_WHITE_SWEET_CLOVER"></a>STRAINS OF WHITE SWEET CLOVER.</p>

<p>A number of different
strains of white sweet
clover are to be found
in the average field, but
most of them are not
as marked or as conspicuous
as the different
strains of red clover.
The principal differences
between strains of
sweet clover are in leafiness,
habit of growth,
and date of blooming.</p>

<p>Occasional plants are
especially heavy seed
producers and bear
many pods containing
more than one seed.
Other plants bloom earlier
than the average
date for white sweet clover, and it may be possible by selecting such
strains to find one which matures early enough to produce two crops a
season at high altitudes in the northern sections of the United States.</p>

<p>Fields of an exceptionally early blooming strain were found in
Illinois, Iowa, and North Dakota in the summer of 1916. The
plants were different in type of growth from the ordinary white
sweet clover, being most conspicuous from the fact that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
in bloom during the first week of June, which is at least three weeks
earlier than the ordinary species should bloom in these localities.</p>

<p>An annual white-flowered sweet clover was found in several localities
in the fall of 1916. The seed which produced these plants was
grown in Alabama. These plants resembled <i>Melilotus alba</i> in most
respects except that they were strictly annual. They flowered and
matured seed abundantly in South Dakota and North Dakota. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
has not been determined whether this is a distinct species or merely
an annual strain of the species mentioned.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="BIENNIAL_YELLOW_SWEET_CLOVER" name="BIENNIAL_YELLOW_SWEET_CLOVER"></a>BIENNIAL YELLOW SWEET CLOVER.</p>

<p>Biennial yellow sweet clover ordinarily is referred to in the seed
trade and among farmers in regions where it is grown simply as
yellow sweet clover. The plants of this species are somewhat
more decumbent the first year, and ordinarily with more
deeply notched leaves than the white-flowering species. Yellow
sweet clover usually grows from 3 to 5 feet in height. This plant
blooms from 10 to 14 days earlier than the white species, and for this
reason it is advisable to sow seed of both plants when they are to be
used for bee pasturage. On account of the finer stems of yellow
sweet clover it is preferred in some localities for hay, but since it
does not produce as much forage as white sweet clover and there is
much less demand for the seed, it constitutes only a very small percentage
of the total acreage. The much larger root growth of the
white species, as illustrated in <a href="#fig5">figure 5</a>, is desirable because of the
additional quantity of hummus added to the soil.</p>

<p>The seeds of the yellow species may usually be distinguished from
those of other species, as some of them are slightly mottled with
purple. The shape of the calyx, which is generally present on unhulled
seed, and the venation of the seed pods also distinguish it.
(See <a href="#fig1">fig. 1.</a>)</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="ANNUAL_YELLOW_SWEET_CLOVER" name="ANNUAL_YELLOW_SWEET_CLOVER"></a>ANNUAL YELLOW SWEET CLOVER.</p>

<p>Annual yellow sweet clover, more commonly known as sour clover
or bitter clover, is found chiefly in the South and Southwest. This
plant is considered a noxious weed in grain fields throughout the
Southwest. It is claimed that the flavor of the seed which is imparted
to wheat can not be removed. Bakers decidedly object to
this flavor, stating that it injures bread. Sour clover is grown rather
extensively as a green-manure crop in orchards in portions of Arizona
and southern California and when properly handled in these
regions it has given profitable results. As the seed is obtained from
the screenings of wheat, it is offered on the market at a very low
price. Occasionally it is sold for the yellow biennial sweet clover.
Seed of this plant should not be sown in any part of the United
States except the extreme South or Southwest, and then only as a
green hay manure crop. Where it is desired to plant sweet clover
for pasturage or for the biennial white or biennial yellow species
should be used.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="OTHER_SPECIES_OF_SWEET_CLOVER" name="OTHER_SPECIES_OF_SWEET_CLOVER"></a>OTHER SPECIES OF SWEET CLOVER.</p>

<p>Thirteen species of sweet clover have been tested by the Office of
Forage-Crop Investigations to determine their economic value. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
the exception of white sweet clover, yellow biennial sweet clover,
and yellow annual sweet clover, but four species in the somewhat
limited tests have given sufficiently good results to merit special attention,
and none have so far proved superior to white sweet clover,
which is now extensively grown in many States.</p>

<p>A species of Trigonella<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is often referred to as blue-flowered melilotus
or blue-flowered sweet clover. While this plant is closely related
to the plants belonging to the genus Melilotus, it does not belong
to this genus and therefore should not be called sweet clover.
It is an erect, quite leafy, very fragrant annual, which produces a
fair growth. It may prove of value as a green-manure crop or as a
catch crop under certain conditions, but at the present time it is not
to be recommended where sweet clover can be grown successfully.
In most tests Trigonella has produced less forage than the better
species of sweet clover.</p>

<p>Sweet clover has been used as a honey plant and for forage and
green-manure for more than 2,000 years in the Mediterranean region,
although it has never been considered of much importance.</p>

<p>The first authentic report of sweet clover in the United States was
in 1739, when Gronovius stated in his Flora Virginica that it was
collected by Clayton. Cutler reported its presence in New England
as early as 1785, and Pursh in 1814 stated in his Flora Americæ
Septentrionulis that it is found on the gravelly shores of rivers from
Pennsylvania to Virginia. Elliott reported the presence of yellow
biennial sweet clover in his Sketch of the Botany of South Carolina
and Georgia in 1824, and Beck found the species <i>Melilotus leucantha</i><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
in the Northern States in 1833.</p>

<p>In 1856 Prof. Tutwiller, of Green Springs Academy, Ala., received
a small quantity of white sweet-clover seed from the secretary to
the United States consul in Chile. Part of this seed was planted by
a young man named Stendwick on his father's plantation on the
prairie limestone belt, where it flourished. This plantation later
became the property of J. T. Collins who, realizing the value of this
plant, sold seed to persons in many States. Not until recently has
sweet clover been grown to any extent as a cultivated crop in this
country.</p>

<p>While sweet clover is to be found growing in many countries and
on all the continents of the world, it is native to temperate Europe
and Asia as far east as Tibet. It is grown to a limited extent in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
England, while in the eastern part of Scotland a small quantity is
considered valuable in hay on account of its agreeable odor. The
famous Cruyere cheese of Switzerland owes its flavor to yellow sweet
clover. In Germany it has given very good results when used as a
green-manure, while in parts of Russian Poland and Austria-Hungary
it is grown as a green-manure, pasturage, and hay crop on poor soils.
This plant is used for forage and as a soil-improving crop in the
central provinces of India, while sour clover, commonly referred to
as <i>Melilotus parviflora</i>, is credited with furnishing 75 per cent of
the feed for the cattle of King Island, Tasmania, which produce
the best beef and butter sold on the Tasmania market.</p>

<p>At the present time sweet clover is grown rather extensively as a
field crop in the limestone regions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky,
in northern Illinois, and throughout the western North-Central
and Mountain States (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>): in fact, it is grown as a cultivated
crop to some extent in nearly every State in the Union. Comparatively
little sweet-clover seed is sown in the Atlantic Coast
States, since there the soils are for the most part acid, and heavy applications
of lime will be necessary before sweet clover can be grown
successfully. It is questionable whether this plant will ever be of
much importance in the South Atlantic States, as cowpeas, soy beans,
and crimson clover will make a fair growth on those soils in their
present condition. The acreage of sweet clover probably will increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
in the New England States, where it should prove of value as
pasturage and as a soil-improving crop on soils where red clover no
longer can be grown. Sweet clover grows abundantly in the limestone
regions of northwestern New York.</p>

<p>A much larger acreage of sweet clover is grown in northern Illinois
than in any other of the eastern North-Central States. The conditions
in the western North-Central States and in the Mountain
States appear to be particularly adapted to this crop. It is in that
part of the country that the largest acreage is found, and, with the
exception of the limestone regions of the South, that the least difficulty
is experienced in obtaining a stand.</p>

<p>In those parts of the Mountain and Pacific Coast States, especially
Utah, where it has not been tested carefully or where red clover
or alfalfa can be grown successfully, sweet clover is looked upon as
a weed. It may rightly be considered a weed in the irrigated regions
of the West and Northwest, where it grows luxuriantly on ditch
Banks. The dissemination of this plant in all parts of the country
has been hastened by beekeepers who have seeded it in waste places
for the production of honey.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="CLIMATIC_ADAPTATIONS" id="CLIMATIC_ADAPTATIONS">CLIMATIC ADAPTATIONS.</a></p>


<p>Sweet clover is adapted to a wider range of climatic conditions
than any of the true clovers and possibly alfalfa; in fact, it may be
grown successfully in any portion of the United States except, perhaps,
Florida, and in Florida trials with biennial yellow sweet clover,
annual sweet clover, and <i>Melilotus suaveolens</i> have been successful.
Apparently neither the high temperatures of the South nor the cold
winters of the North severely affect the plants, provided there is
sufficient moisture in the soil. Comparatively little winterkilling is
experienced in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and North Dakota when
the seed is sown in close drills or broadcasted. Although approximately
50 per cent of the sweet clover seeded in rows 3 feet apart at
Moccasin, Mont., was killed by the unusually severe winter of
1915-16, no winterkilling was noted in plats seeded in close drills.</p>

<p>Sweet clover thrives in the more humid parts of the country, as
well as in the semiarid regions where the rainfall is but three-fifths
of that required for the normal growth of such crops as red clover
and timothy. In the semiarid regions of the West sweet clover has
proved to be somewhat more drought resistant than alfalfa.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="REQUIREMENTS_FOR_OBTAINING_A_STAND" id="REQUIREMENTS_FOR_OBTAINING_A_STAND">REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A STAND.</a></p>


<p>The requirements for obtaining a stand of sweet clover are somewhat
exacting. It is for this reason that so many failures have
been experienced. It must not be assumed, because sweet clover is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
found growing luxuriantly in many waste places and on uncultivated
land, that a stand may be obtained by planting it at any time
of the year, in any manner, and under all conditions. Throughout
the eastern and southern portions of the country, with the exception
of a few regions rich in limestone, much care must be used in the
preparation of the seed bed, the selection of seed, and the manner of
seeding if success is to be expected. For this reason it is necessary
to understand fully the requirements for obtaining and maintaining
a successful stand.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SOILS_SUITABLE_FOR_SWEET_CLOVER" name="SOILS_SUITABLE_FOR_SWEET_CLOVER"></a>SOILS SUITABLE FOR SWEET CLOVER.</p>

<p>Sweet clover thrives on the adobe and granitic soils of the Pacific
coast; upon the gumbo, hardpan, prairie, and sandy soils of the
western North-Central States; and upon the heavy clay, loam, limestone,
and sandy soils of the South and East. In fact, it has been
grown successfully on all the principal soil types of the United States
where the soils were not acid and were well inoculated. It grows
luxuriantly on the Selma chalk (rotten-limestone) soils of Alabama
and upon soils rich in calcium carbonate in many parts of the country
where the lack of nitrogen and humus has caused large numbers of
farms to be abandoned. The plants thrive on newly exposed heavy
clay soils and upon steep embankments where little else will grow.
Sweet clover is more tolerant of poor drainage, overflow, and seepage
conditions than alfalfa. In irrigated sections, especially where the
reservoir system is in use, large bodies of land are likely to become
useless for the growth of alfalfa because of the rising of the water
table. On such areas sweet clover will make a vigorous growth.
However, maximum growth is to be expected only on well-drained
soil.</p>

<p>Sweet clover will do well on many soils which are not fertile
enough to grow red clover or alfalfa, and it is on these soils that it
will prove most valuable. Like many other plants, it makes its best
growth on fertile soils rich in calcium carbonate, although it will
make sufficient growth on poor soils which are not acid to warrant
planting it on them. Many hilly pastures may profitably be seeded
to sweet clover. It will not only make a valuable addition to the
forage of these pastures but will improve the soil so that grasses will
grow more abundantly. Some of the best pastures in the Middle
West are composed of bluegrass, timothy, and sweet clover.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="RESISTANCE_TO_ALKALI" name="RESISTANCE_TO_ALKALI"></a>RESISTANCE TO ALKALI.</p>

<p>Sweet clover grows successfully on soils in the West which apparently
are too alkaline for grains or alfalfa. The Wyoming Agricultural
Experiment Station reports that it has obtained good yields of
sweet clover on seepage land which is so strongly alkaline that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
other plants except some of the native grasses will survive, while the
California Agricultural Experiment Station found that sweet clover
will withstand alkali to a remarkable degree. Prof. F. S. Harris,
agronomist of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station at Logan,
claims that it is one of the most alkali-resistant crops grown in Utah,
and that in and 1913 and 1914 quite an industry developed in some parts
of that State in growing sweet clover for hay and seed on land too
alkaline for other crops.</p>

<p>In reply to a circular letter on the culture of sweet clover, approximately
100 county agents and extensive growers of this crop located
in many parts of the West state that this plant is one of the most
alkali-resistant plants grown in their respective districts. In Crook
County, Oreg., a good stand was obtained from April seeding in 1915
on a 20-acre demonstration field of sandy loam bottom land so
strongly alkaline from black alkali that only salt grass was growing
on it before it was planted to sweet clover. This field pastured from
18 to 28 head of calves, cows, and horses from June 1 to October 1
without being irrigated. Sweet clover generally will grow on soils
where salt grass<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> will survive, and it is very much superior to this
grass as pasture. After the drainage of water-logged land on which
there is a surface accumulation of alkali, it is the common practice
in parts of Utah to grow sweet clover for several years before planting
alfalfa. It is often stated that alkali land will grow less tolerant
crops after sweet clover has been grown on it for a few years.
The long roots will open up the subsoil and cause better drainage,
thereby affording an excellent means for removing the salts from the
soil, as they are readily soluble in water.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="NEED_OF_LIME_ON_ACID_SOILS" name="NEED_OF_LIME_ON_ACID_SOILS"></a>NEED OF LIME ON ACID SOILS.</p>

<p>Sweet clover, like many other legumes, requires a soil containing
an abundance of limestone if a maximum growth is to be expected.
Throughout the world it makes a luxuriant growth only on calcareous
soils. On the black prairie limestone soils of Alabama and
Mississippi it grows luxuriantly, although in this region it is very
seldom found on the outcroppings of red clay, which are acid. The
distribution corresponds sharply with the line of demarcation between
the black prairie soils and other soil types. In some places
sweet clover makes a vigorous growth on the Selma chalk (rotten-limestone)
soils, while none is to be found on red post-oak clay but
a few yards away; yet sweet clover will grow on the red post-oak clay
after the soil has received an application of lime. It will thrive
on the bald lime-rock spots and rotten-limestone hills of Mississippi,
which are so barren that practically no other plants will survive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
Thus it appears that lime is essential for the maximum growth of
sweet clover in this Region.</p>

<p>The reason for the exceptional growth of sweet clover in north-central
Kentucky is undoubtedly the fact that these soils contain
an abundant supply of limestone. The Kentucky Agricultural
Experiment Station states that this area is the only portion of the
State where sweet clover is being grown with general success without
applying lime.</p>

<p>Soils on which sweet clover is aggressive are almost invariably
alkaline or but slightly acid. This plant is often found in valleys of
streams in localities where the soils are supposedly acid, but such
streams generally have their origin in limestone areas or flow through
limestone regions, and calcium carbonate is thus deposited in these
valleys during flood periods with the sedimentary deposits from flood
waters. Sweet clover often appears in deep cuts along highways or
railroads in localities where the soil is known to be acid and where
sweet clover has not previously grown. In many of these cuts the
acid soil has been removed and neutral or alkaline subsoil exposed,
or limestone has been used in ballasting or road making and the dust
has blown on the exposed soil. It is a very common occurrence to
find sweet clover making an abundant growth along macadamized
roads from which the wind has scattered the finely pulverized limestone.</p>

</div>

<p>An application of burnt lime or finely ground limestone has made
the difference between success and failure in most experiments which
have thus far been conducted on decidedly acid soils. (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7.</a>)</p>

<p>A number of sweet-clover experiments were performed on acid soils
and on adjacent plats or fields of the same type of soil that had received
applications of limestone varying from 1 to 4 tons to the
acre. There was a marked difference in the stands obtained and in
the growth of the plants on the limed and unlimed areas. In some
cases the difference in growth was so marked that the last round of
the lime spreader could be distinguished at some distance from the
plats. The stands were much heavier on the limed areas and the
plants made from two to three times more growth than those on the
unlimed plats. Yields of hay were doubled on soils that received only
sufficient limestone to neutralize the acids in the surface soil, although
the yields were further increased when more limestone was added.</p>

<p>Mr. W. E. Watkins, county agent of Allen County, Kans., made
counts of the number of plants which winterkilled during the winter
of 1914-15 on given areas of limed and unlimed soil. It was found
that from 15 to 35 per cent more plants winterkilled on the unlimed
soil than on the limed areas. That portion of the unlimed field on
which the fewest plants winterkilled was found to have the lowest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
lime requirement. On the unlimed areas with a low lime requirement
15 per cent more plants winterkilled than on the limed areas; on those
with a high lime requirement the increase in winterkilling was 33
per cent. In the fall of 1914 the hay cut from the limed areas exceeded
that from the areas with a low lime requirement by 600 pounds
per acre and exceeded that from the areas of high lime requirement
by 4,000 pounds per
acre. In July, 1915, the
increase in hay yield
on the limed areas over
that from the areas with
a low and with a high
lime requirement was
2,300 and 9,400 pounds
per acre, respectively.
The area of high lime
requirement returned a
small yield in 1914 and
no hay in 1915.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact
that sweet clover is as
sensitive to soil acidity
as red clover or alfalfa,
a large percentage of
the acreage thus far
seeded in the eastern
half of the United
States has been composed
of acid soils, and
this soil acidity undoubtedly
is responsible
for a very large percentage
of the failures
with sweet clover in
this section. Where
sweet clover is to be
sown on acid soils a sufficient
quantity of lime
should first be applied to at least neutralize the fields in the soil to
a depth of 6 inches. An application of 1 ton of burnt lime or 2 tons
of finely ground limestone will usually be sufficient for this purpose.</p>

<p>Fields have been noted where sweet clover was making a fair
growth on apparently acid soils. Such fields usually are rich in
humus or phosphorus and are exceptional cases rather than the rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span></p>

<p>Soil types which have slightly acid surface soils and alkaline subsoils
will grow sweet clover successfully, provided the acid soil is
not more than 6 to 12 inches in depth.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="FERTILIZERS" name="FERTILIZERS"></a>FERTILIZERS.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that sweet clover thrives on the barren Selma
chalk (rotten-limestone) hills of Alabama and Mississippi and grows
abundantly on worn-out, abandoned land in north-central Kentucky,
it is often assumed that it will grow on soils too depleted in plant
food to produce other crops. These regions represent soils which
have become exhausted primarily in nitrogen and humus as the result
of continuous cropping with nonleguminous plants. Some of
these soils contain sufficient phosphorus and potassium for fair crop
production, although this supply may be in such a condition that it
will not become available fast enough to supply the needs of most
crops. Sweet clover, like all legumes, has the power to extract nitrogen
from the atmosphere, and on account of its extensive root system
it is able to obtain phosphorus and potassium from a larger area
than most plants. The large roots not only add a quantity of humus
and nitrogen to the soil but they also open it up to a considerable
depth, thus providing better aeration and improving its physical
condition. Improved physical condition causes the bacterial flora to
increase and thereby indirectly causes a larger quantity of unavailable
phosphorus and potassium to be made available for plant use.</p>

<p>On soils which are known to be low in phosphorus or potassium
an application of fertilizer containing the necessary element should
be made when sweet clover is sown without a nurse crop. However,
when it is sown with a nurse crop or in the late summer or early fall
on grain stubble, the residues left in the soil from fertilizers applied
to the nurse crop will, under ordinary conditions, be sufficient for
the plants. That sweet clover will respond readily to applications
of phosphorus on soils low in this element has been well demonstrated
by the farmers of Livingston County, Ill. In this county finely
ground rock phosphate was applied to a portion of a number of
fields at the rate of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds per acre. The phosphate
was thoroughly incorporated with the soil just before seeding oats
and sweet clover. In the growth of sweet clover there was a marked
difference the following year between the treated and untreated portions
of the fields. Those portions of the fields which received an
application of phosphate not only contained many more plants on a
given area, but the vigor and growth of the plants were most marked.
On June 1 the plants on the treated areas were 12 to 15 inches taller
than those on the untreated parts of the fields. This difference in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
thickness of stand and the height of plants was so striking that the
last round of the phosphate spreader was plainly distinguishable.</p>

<p>Yields of sweet-clover hay have been increased as much as 2 tons per
acre from applications of barnyard manure. Such an increased yield
would be equal approximately to 8 tons of green-manure. Some
people may consider it poor farm practice to apply manure to such
crops as sweet clover, but it is very probable that the cumulative
effect of the increased yields of the following crops, especially on
soils low in organic matter, will be greater than if the manure is
applied to other crops. Heavy applications of manure to the preceding
crop should also greatly benefit sweet clover.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="USE_OF_A_NURSE_CROP" name="USE_OF_A_NURSE_CROP"></a>USE OF A NURSE CROP.</p>

<p>If sweet clover is to become an important crop throughout the
North-Central States it must necessarily be seeded with grain.
Good success has been obtained by seeding sweet clover in the spring
on winter grain or with spring grain on soil that was inoculated
and not acid. Seed may be broadcasted in the early spring on winter
grain when the ground is in a honeycombed condition, or it may be
sown later when the ground may be cultivated. A large acreage of
sweet clover is sown in the western North-Central States and in
Illinois in the spring with oats, barley, or wheat as a nurse crop.
Early varieties of oats and spring wheat have given somewhat better
results in portions of the Northwest than barley. In Illinois
oats are used almost entirely. Only a few fields were noted where
flax had been used as a nurse crop, but in these fields it was successful.
In wet seasons the sweet clover may make a growth sufficiently
large to interfere seriously with harvesting the flax. On this account
this combination should be tested thoroughly in an experimental way
before being recommended for general field practice.</p>

<p>In those sections of the country where the moisture supply is limited,
sweet clover should be sown without a nurse crop. Failure to
obtain a stand is more likely to occur when the seed is sown with
grain than when it is sown alone, because during dry weather, which
is likely to occur when the grain is maturing, the supply of moisture
in the soil is apt to be insufficient for both crops. When this condition
prevails the clover will suffer badly and in some cases be
killed. When sweet clover is sown with a nurse crop it is strongly
recommended that the grain be seeded at not more than two-thirds
the usual rate. This will give the sweet clover a much better chance
than when a full seeding is made. When severe droughts occur it
may be necessary to cut the grain for hay if the stand is to be saved.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="CHOICE_OF_SEED" name="CHOICE_OF_SEED"></a>CHOICE OF SEED.</p>

<p>On account of the low germination of much of the sweet-clover
seed offered for sale it is very important that seed be tested for germination
before planting. Low germination usually is due to the
fact that many of the seeds remain hard after they have been in
the germinator or soil for a month or more. The seed coats of hard
sweet-clover seeds become permeable to water very slowly, if at all,
in storage. The germination of such seeds is greatly increased, however,
when they are subjected for a time to alternating temperatures,
such as freezing and thawing. It is on this account that unhulled
seed, which germinates poorly in the laboratory, often will produce
good stands when sown during the winter. When sweet clover is to
be sown in the spring it is very important that only hulled seed
which germinates 75 per cent or more be sown. As explained later
under the heading "Seeding," unhulled seed which has a low germination
should be used for seeding only during the winter months, so
that there will be sufficient time for the alternating temperatures of
winter and early spring to cause it to germinate during favorable
weather.</p>

<p>Hulled seed usually germinates much better than unhulled seed,
as is shown in Table I.</p>

<p>Table I shows that northern-grown seed germinates better than
northern-grown seed and imported seed better than either. The low
germination of the southern-grown seed is probably due to the fact
that a very large percentage of it is flailed out and sown in the hull.
Northern-grown seed generally is thrashed with either a grain separator
or a clover huller. Imported seed always is hulled. In hulling
seed the rasps or concaves of the machines scratch the seed coats
sufficiently to permit water to penetrate them, so that the germination
is greatly increased. Apparently there is no reason why southern-grown
seed when it is properly hulled should not germinate as
well as northern-grown seed.</p>

the market, it is possible to buy scarified seed. This machine is so
constructed that the seed is forced through a conveyor, part of which
is covered with sandpaper. When the seed comes in contact with
the sandpaper it is scratched, so that water will penetrate the seed
coats. When this machine is run properly the germination of seed
is greatly increased, but when carelessly operated germination may
be lessened, as many of the seeds may be broken.</p>

<p>The retarded germination of sweet-clover seed may be overcome
by soaking it in commercial concentrated sulphuric acid for 20
minutes. It should then be washed quickly, using running water if
possible, as sulphuric acid becomes very hot when mixed with small
proportions of water. A great deal of water therefore is necessary
in order to lessen the danger of burning. The seed should be dried
quickly by spreading it out on a floor or canvas, and it should be
stirred at intervals. Unhulled seed should never be treated with
sulphuric acid. When only a small quantity of sulphuric acid comes
in contact with the hulls a very high temperature will result and
the seed will be killed. The treatment of seed with sulphuric acid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
for seeding on a field scale is not to be recommended, in view of
the fact that as good or better results may be obtained by using
scarified seed.</p>

<p>It is very important that seed of the desired species be obtained.
Many lots of sweet-clover seed offered for sale on the market consist
of mixtures of the yellow and white species, and many samples also
are adulterated with alfalfa. Seed which is simply labeled sweet
clover should never be purchased, as seed so labeled may be any one
of the several varieties offered for sale. It is always best to state
the specific kind of seed ordered and then submit a sample to either
your State Agricultural experiment Station or one of the seed laboratories

<p class="caption3"><a id="PREPARATION_OF_THE_SEED_BED" name="PREPARATION_OF_THE_SEED_BED"></a>PREPARATION OF THE SEED BED.</p>

<p>Sweet clover requires a well-settled and firm seed bed, with just
sufficient loose soil on the surface to permit the seed to be well
covered. When the seed is sown in the spring on winter grain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
the seed bed usually is in good condition. At this season of the
year the seed may be sown, so that it will be covered by freezing
and thawing weather. It may be sown also when the ground is
in condition to cultivate and then may be harrowed or drilled in.
When the seed is sown with spring grain the seed bed is not as firm
as it should be for the prompt germination and establishment of the
young clover plants. If sown in this manner the soil should be
worked into a fine condition and firmed as much as possible. It is
good practice to roll the ground with a corrugated roller after seeding.
Better stands are usually obtained by seeding on fields that
have been disked and harrowed than on those that have been plowed.</p>

<p>When sweet clover is seeded without a nurse crop it should not
be sown on freshly plowed land which has had no opportunity to
settle. The land preferably should be plowed several months before
the seed is to be sown, and then worked at intervals with soil packers
or harrows. Double disking and harrowing just previous to seeding
are to be strongly recommended in preference to plowing at
this time.</p>

<p>When sweet clover is to be seeded in the fall on grain stubble,
the ground should be disked and worked into good condition as soon
as the grain can be removed. If the seed is sown immediately the
field should be rolled after seeding.</p>

<p>Fall-plowed ground ordinarily makes an ideal seed bed for spring
seeding. Soil which has been previously planted to a cultivated
crop, such as corn, is usually put in sufficiently good condition for
sweet clover by disking. Good success has been attained by merely
broadcasting the seed on sandy soil and scratching it in with a
harrow. Such a seed bed appears to be ideal when the seed can
be covered sufficiently to insure plenty of moisture. It must be remembered
that young sweet-clover plants are not drought resistant
and that every precaution should be taken in seasons of drought or
on laud which drought affects badly to so prepare the seed bed that
the largest quantity of moisture will be conserved.</p>

<p>Excellent stands have been obtained at times by double-disking
native prairie sod and either covering the seed with a harrow or
sowing it with a drill.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="SEEDING" id="SEEDING">SEEDING.</a></p>


<p>The proper time to seed sweet clover should be determined by the
germination of the seed, the climatic conditions of the region, and
the condition of the seed bed at the time of sowing. When growing
under natural conditions, seed which has lain in the ground over
winter germinates in sufficient quantity during the following spring
to produce a stand. It is therefore assumed that since this seed
has passed the winter on or in the ground and has produced a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
stand the following spring, sweet clover may be sown at any time
of the year and a satisfactory stand obtained. Little is thought of
the enormous number of seeds which shatter from a single plant and
fall on an area not exceeding 5 or 6 feet in diameter. Single plants
have produced as many as 350,000 seeds (the approximate number
in 1½ pounds), or about 10,000 seeds for each square foot of ground
covered. It matters little how many of these seeds germinate in the
fall they mature or during the following winter, when the seedlings
will be killed by freezing, for there will be enough viable seeds
left in the ground to germinate when conditions are favorable in
the spring. Conditions are very different when sweet clover is sown
on cultivated soil at the rate of 5 to 20 pounds of seed to the acre&mdash;25
to 100 seeds to the square foot. When this quantity is sown,
it is necessary that it be planted at such a time that the greatest
number of seeds will germinate and produce plants.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="HULLED_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED" name="HULLED_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED"></a>HULLED SWEET-CLOVER SEED.</p>

<p>Hulled seed makes up a large percentage of the sweet-clover seed
sown. The germination of hulled seed varies considerably, although
ordinarily it is higher than that of unhulled seed. Seeding experiments
conducted at Arlington, Va., with seed which germinated
80 per cent show clearly that seed which germinates well should not
be sown during the winter months in those sections of the country
where midwinter thaws are likely to occur, and especially in sections
south of the latitude of southern Ohio. In these experiments seed
was sown during each month of the winter. Good stands were obtained
only on those plats which were sown in the latter part of
February and during March and April. At least 75 per cent of
the seed sown during November, December, and January germinated
on warm days during winter thaws and was killed by later cold
weather. Notwithstanding the fact that sweet-clover seedlings will
endure fairly low temperatures, seed germinating more than 50 per
cent should not be sown during the winter months, and preferably
not more than a week previous to the average date for the last
severe freeze.</p>

<p>No data have been secured on winter seeding in those portions of
the United States where open winters do not occur. It is probable
that in those sections the winters are sufficiently cold to prevent
germination before spring. Good results may be obtained by winter
seeding, but as usually no trouble is experienced in those sections in
obtaining a stand by seeding as soon as the soil can be worked in the
spring, it is strongly recommended that seeding be done with hulled
seed, which germinates well at this time of the year.</p>

<p>Many excellent stands have been obtained by seeding late in the
spring, but in most sections seeding at this time is not as certain to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
produce a good stand as earlier seeding. Late spring seeding may
be preferable when the ground is weedy and the clover is to be seeded
without nurse crop. Under these circumstances a crop of weeds
may be destroyed before seeding.</p>

<p>Very good success has been obtained in the Southern and Central
States, and in some of the Northern States, by seeding sweet clover
in the late summer or early autumn. When there is sufficient moisture
in the soil for germination and when good seed is used, better stands
have been obtained by seeding about eight weeks before severe frosts
are to be expected than from spring sowing. This is particularly
true in regions where late spring droughts or severe summer droughts
are likely to occur. Seeding at this time may be done after an early
crop has been harvested and when weeds are not likely to be troublesome.
Plants from fall seeding mature from 10 days to two weeks
later the following season than plants from spring sowing of the
same year. The later time of maturing is an advantage, in that the
plants will be ready to cut during better haying weather. The root
growth is not as large from fall seeding as from spring seeding, and
therefore not quite as much humus is added to the soil. Late fall
seedings are very likely to be injured from heaving on wet clay soils.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="UNHULLED_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED" name="UNHULLED_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED"></a>UNHULLED SWEET-CLOVER SEED.</p>

<p>Unhulled sweet-clover seed is sown principally in Kentucky, Alabama,
and Mississippi. On the limestone soils of regions, which
appear to be naturally adapted to sweet clover, very good results are
obtained by using unhulled seed. It is not because southern-grown
unhulled seed germinates better than northern-grown unhulled seed
that better stands are obtained in the South from it, but it is mainly
because southern farmers better understand the somewhat exacting
conditions necessary for obtaining a stand with this kind of seed.
Unhulled sweet clover contains a large percentage of hard seeds
which will not germinate until they have been in the soil for some
time and have been subjected to varying temperatures.</p>

<p>Seeding experiments have been conducted at Arlington, Va., where
unhulled seed which contained 90 per cent of hard seed was sown
during each month of the winter. Good stands were obtained on
those plats seeded at the rate of 24 pounds (3 pecks) of seed to the
acre during December and January, and fair stands on the plats
seeded at this rate in February. Later seedings failed to produce
a stand.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the unhulled seed sown in the South is
seeded during January and the first part of February. Good stands
are seldom obtained from unhulled seed south of the latitude of
Washington, D. C., when the seed is sown later than the middle of
February.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span></p>

<p>The use of unhulled seed has usually been attended with failure
in the northern portion of the United States, although occasionally
good stands have been obtained the following spring from late fall
seeding. This failure is in part due to the fact that the seed has
been sown in the spring and at a tine when only seed germinating
well should be used. When unhulled seed is to be sown north of the
latitude of Washington, D. C., it should be sown not later than February
15, and preferably earlier. Observations show that fairly
good stands may be obtained by seeding during the winter, but care
should be taken not to sow seed earlier than necessary on land which
is subject to washing. Farmers should have no trouble in purchasing
hulled seed, and therefore it is recommended that only hulled seed
which germinates well be sown.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="RATE_OF_SEEDING" name="RATE_OF_SEEDING"></a>RATE OF SEEDING.</p>

<p>The rate at which sweet clover should be seeded varies with the
germination of the seed, the condition of the seed bed, the climatic
conditions of the region, and the method of seeding. Throughout the
humid sections of the eastern United States sweet clover ordinarily
is seeded at the rate of 15 to 20 pounds of hulled seed to the acre.
From 12 to 15 pounds should be ample where the seed bed is in good
condition and the seed germinates 75 per cent or more. In Illinois,
the western North-Central States, the Mountain States, and the
Pacific Coast States good stands are generally obtained by sowing 10
to 12 pounds of hulled seed to the acre. In eastern Washington it is
claimed that from 5 to 8 pounds to the acre are sufficient for good
stands.</p>

<p>When sweet clover is grown under irrigation, 8 to 10 pounds of
hulled seed usually are sufficient, and from 2 to 4 pounds per acre
are enough when seeded in rows from 2 to 4 feet apart. Of unhulled
seed 3 to 6 pecks (24 to 48 pounds) or 20 pounds of hulled seed are
usually sown in the South for pasturage or hay. In any region at
least 10 pounds more of the unhulled than of hulled seed should be
sown to an acre. Unless annual yellow sweet-clover seed is
thoroughly cleaned it should be sown at the rate of 25 to 30 pounds
to the acre.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="METHODS_OF_SEEDING" name="METHODS_OF_SEEDING"></a>METHODS OF SEEDING.</p>

<p>The methods used for seeding red clover or alfalfa in any particular
region will be suitable for seeding sweet clover. Good results
have been obtained by broadcasting the seed on winter grain
in the spring when the ground is in a honeycombed condition. Perhaps
a better method is to wait until the ground can be worked and
then to broadcast and cover the seed with a harrow or to sow it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
a drill. Unhulled seed is usually broadcasted, since it is necessary to
sow it before the ground is in condition to be worked. Unless the
hulls have been rubbed smooth, some difficulty may be experienced
in seeding it evenly with a drill.</p>

<p>When sweet clover is to be sown with spring-seeded grain or when
it is to lie sown without a nurse crop it may be drilled in or sown
broadcast and covered with a harrow. Better stands are generally
obtained with a smaller quantity of seed when it is sown with the
drill than when it is broadcasted on honeycombed ground. When
the seed is sown at the time the grain is planted, the grass-seeder
attachment of the drill commonly is used. In some sections the end-gate
seeder is used almost entirely. When the seed is sown by
either of these methods it may be seeded alone or mixed with the
grain. When only the clover seed is sown with a drill, the alfalfa
and clover seed drills are to be preferred.</p>

<p>Sweet-clover seed may be mixed with some inert substance of approximately
the same size and weight and sown with an ordinary
grain drill. Finely cracked corn, cracked wheat, or coarse bran
often are used for this purpose. When one portion of sweet clover is
mixed with two portions of a filler find the drill is set to sow one-half
bushel of wheat, it will usually sow from 15 to 20 pounds of
sweet clover to the acre. As this quantity will vary with the different
types of drills, it is necessary to test each drill, so that the seed
may be mixed with the filler in such proportions that the desired
quantity will be sown. The drill may be tested by blocking it up,
so that the geared wheel is off the ground, and this wheel may be
turned a sufficient number of times to establish a definite portion of an
acre. The seed that runs through can then be weighed and the rate
per acre determined. The rate may be determined more accurately
by plugging up the grain tubes or by tying a small sack on each tube
and pulling the drill for a specific distance over the field to be sown.
The jar of the drill will cause it to drop more seed than when it is
blocked up and run by hand.</p>

<p>It is often desired to seed sweet clover on land which can not be
cultivated. When sown on such land it is recommended that unhulled
seed or seed that contains a large percentage of hard seed be
used and that it be broadcasted during the winter. The subsequent
freezing and thawing will cover many of the seeds and cause them
to germinate. It is a good plan to scatter in deep gulleys mature
plants that have not shattered all their seed. The branches of these
plants will help to hold the seed in place until it germinates and the
young plants become established.</p>

<p>Seed may be scattered on native prairie ground in the late winter,
but unless it is trampled into the ground by live stock disappointing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
results are likely to be obtained at first. Fair results have been
secured by planting seed with disk drills on prairie sod after it had
been double-disked in the early spring. This method should be
used in preference to broadcasting the seed and depending on cattle
to trample it in. Mr. George Hummer, of Prairie Point, Miss., reports
good success in his locality by simply broadcasting 1 peck of
unhulled seed on Bermuda-grass
sod not later
than January 1.</p>

upon the available
nitrogen in the soil for
their supply, and as the
crop is grown for the
most part on soils low
in nitrogen the plants
can not be expected to
make more than a small
growth. (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9.</a>)</p>

<p>Arny and Thatcher, at
the Minnesota Agricultural
Experiment Station,
obtained 10 times as
much dry matter in the
tops and seven times as
much in the roots of
sweet-clover plants which
had been grown on thoroughly
inoculated soil as
from plants Which had been grown on soil not inoculated. Moreover,
the plants grown on the inoculated soil contained 117 pounds
more nitrogen to the acre than those grown on the uninoculated soil.</p>

<p>Experiments in many other sections of the country, and especially
in the northeastern quarter of the United States, where but
little sweet clover or alfalfa has thus far been grown, show that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
inoculation is very essential to success. Ordinarily it is not necessary
to inoculate sweet clover when it is to be planted on land where
alfalfa, bur-clover, or black medic thrives, because the same strain
of inoculating germs inoculates all of these plants. However, when
this closer is to be planted on land where none of the plants inoculated
by this strain of the organism have been grown, inoculation
should be provided. In localities where sweet clover or other plants
inoculated by the same strain of bacteria thrive, the early growth
has at times been made much more vigorous by inoculating the soil
or seed thoroughly.</p>

<p>It is not safe to assume that a certain piece of soil is inoculated
because any one of the plants inoculated by the same strain of the
organism is growing or has been grown on other fields in the same
vicinity. Many fields have come under observation where sweet
clover was a failure because the plants were not inoculated, when
plats or fields of alfalfa growing near by were abundantly inoculated.</p>

<p>There are several methods of inoculating sweet clover, any one of
which when properly applied should give good results.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_SOIL-TRANSFER_METHOD" name="THE_SOIL-TRANSFER_METHOD"></a>THE SOIL-TRANSFER METHOD.</p>

<p>The soil-transfer method of inoculation consists in scattering over
the field to be seeded 200 to 400 pounds to the acre of soil collected
from sweet-clover, alfalfa, or bur-clover fields where the healthy
plants show an abundance of tubercles on the roots. It is strongly
recommended that this soil be scattered on a cloudy day or in the
early morning or in the evening and immediately harrowed or disked
into the ground, as the sun's rays are very injurious to the inoculating
germs. It is a good plan for the person scattering the soil to
walk directly in front of the harrow. When this practice is followed
little harm can be done by the light. To facilitate even scattering,
the soil may be mixed thoroughly with two or three times its weight
of other soil, preferably from the field where the sweet clover is to
be sown. Soil used for inoculating sweet clover does not necessarily
have to be scattered on the land just previous to sowing the seed. It
may be scattered a few months or a year in advance of the time the
sweet clover is to be seeded and be just as effective as if it were
scattered at a later time. In general, where sweet clover is to be
seeded in the spring on winter grain, the inoculation should be applied
before the grain is sown.</p>

<p>Good success has been obtained by drying in a dark place soil containing
the inoculating germs, sifting it, and running it through the
fertilizer compartment of a grain drill. When this method is employed
it is not necessary to use as much soil as when it is scattered
broadcast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span></p>

<p>A comparatively new method which has given successful results
calls for dampening each bushel of seed and spreading it on a cloth,
paper, or cement floor, where half a gallon of throughly inoculated
soil from sweet-clover or alfalfa plants may be sifted over it. Some
people prefer to add a trace of glue or sugar to water, so that
more of the soil will adhere to the seed, although some soil will remain
on the seed if the glue or sugar is not used. When only this quantity
of soil is used it should be collected from around the roots of
sweet-clover plants which are abundantly inoculated. Such soil
may be collected in the fall and kept until spring in a cool, dry, dark
place with no injury to the inoculating organisms. Seed treated in
this manner should be kept in the dark and should be sown as soon
as possible after treating.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="THE_PURE-CULTURE_METHOD" name="THE_PURE-CULTURE_METHOD"></a>THE PURE-CULTURE METHOD.</p>

<p>The pure-culture method has the advantage of greater case of
transportation and freedom from danger of introducing harmful
pests upon the farm. Inoculation by pure cultures may be carried
out in either of two ways:</p>

<p>(1) A bottle of pure culture of the proper kind of bacteria is
opened and the culture mixed with a convenient quantity of water;
this diluted culture now is mixed thoroughly with a considerable
quantity of soil, preferably from the field where the legume is to be
sown; the treated soil is then distributed in the same manner as
when inoculation is made by the soil-transfer method.</p>

<p>(2) A pure culture of the proper kind of bacteria should be applied
to the seeds in such a way that they will all be moistened.
The seed should then be permitted to dry in a shady or dark place
and should be planted as soon as possible after it is dry. Drying
may be facilitated by adding dry, sifted soil, preferably from the
field where the seed is to be sown. Inoculating organisms very often
die within a week after the seed is inoculated. It is highly desirable,
therefore that the inoculation be made the day the seed is sown.
Inoculated seed never should be dried in the sun.</p>

<p>The question is often asked whether it is advisable to inoculate
seed with pure-culture method and sow it on honeycombed
ground in the spring. No experiments have thus far been completed
to determine the advisability of this procedure. Some inoculation
would probably result from this practice, because the bacteria on
that portion of the seed next to the ground would be protected from
the sunlight and would in a short time under ordinary conditions be
covered by the freezing and thawing of the soil. While it is hardly
possible to obtain as complete inoculation by this practice as by other
methods, it is to be preferred to no inoculation.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="TREATMENT_OF_THE_STAND" id="TREATMENT_OF_THE_STAND">TREATMENT OF THE STAND.</a></p>


<p>The manner in which a stand of sweet clover is handled should
depend somewhat upon the method and date of seeding and the purpose
for which it is sown. Climatic conditions should also be taken
into consideration and the handling of the crop governed accordingly.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="TREATMENT_THE_FIRST_SEASON" name="TREATMENT_THE_FIRST_SEASON"></a>TREATMENT THE FIRST SEASON.</p>

<p>The most serious objection to seeding sweet clover in the spring
without a nurse crop is weeds. In many sections of the country
seeds will take as much water from the soil and make as much or
more shade than a crop of grain. In spite of the fact that sweet
clover will withstand more adverse conditions than red clover or
alfalfa, a heavy growth of weeds will greatly retard the growth of
the plants and in some cases kill most of them. (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10.</a>) On
plats sown in April without a nurse crop at Arlington, Va., it was
necessary to mow weeds five times during the summer of 1915 in
order to keep them partly checked. Where it is necessary to mow
a field so many times the plants are not only checked or killed, but
as much time is required for this work as would be necessary to
harvest a crop of grain. This trouble may be overcome in part by
pasturing the sweet clover the first season, but even then during wet
weather it may be necessary to cut the weeds at least once before
the plants become well enough established to turn live stock on the
field. The plants should at no time be clipped closer than 5 inches
from the ground.</p>

<p>After a field of sweet clover has become well established, it may
be pastured throughout the summer and fall. Close grazing should
be avoided during the summer, or the plants may be killed, but they
may be pastured fairly close to the ground in the autumn, as it does
not appear as necessary to provide a winter covering as is the case
with red clover. Close pasturing or clipping late in the fall has
had a marked effect on the growth of the plants the following spring
on some fields and no apparent effect on the stand and growth of
the plants on other fields. A portion of a field in Livingston County,
Ill., was clipped close to the ground in the late fall of 1915. On
June 1, 1916, the stand was somewhat heavier on the unclipped part
of the field. More noticeable than the thickness of the stand was
the fact that the plants on the unclipped portion were 8 to 10 inches
higher than those on the clipped area. It is reasonable to believe
that plants going into the winter with no protection are more likely
to be injured than those having some protection.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many fields in different parts of the country
have been closely clipped or pastured in the late fall with no noticeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
injury. Because of the value of the hay or pasturage in the late
summer and autumn of the year of seeding, it is strongly recommended
that the first year's growth be utilized. If the field be cut for hay
it is well to leave a 4-inch or 5-inch stubble, as this will serve to catch
drifting snow during the winter, thereby adding to the protection
against winterkilling. If the field is not pastured the first season and
weeds are not troublesome, a cutting of hay may be made when
growth ceases in the fall.</p>

<span class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;White sweet-clover plant (at the left), showing the effect of a heavy growth
of weeds. Had the weeds not been present the plant at the left should have been
larger than the one at the right, as the seed was sown two weeks earlier and the
other conditions for growth were ideal. Four-fifths of the plants on the plat which
had a heavy growth of weeds were entirely killed.</span>
</div>

<p>When sweet clover is seeded with grain, moisture conditions should
serve to determine whether the grain should be permitted to ripen or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
be cut for hay. When untimely droughts appear the plants may be
killed if the grain is not cut as early as possible.</p>

<p>In the South and in some sections of the Eastern and North-Central
States where the soil contains an abundance of limestone
and is well inoculated, a cutting of hay may usually be obtained after
a grain crop has been harvested. In other sections of the North in
only exceptionally favorable weather will more than pasturage be
obtained after the grain is cut.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="TREATMENT_THE_SECOND_SEASON" name="TREATMENT_THE_SECOND_SEASON"></a>TREATMENT THE SECOND SEASON.</p>

<p>One of the special advantages of sweet clover is that it produces
good pasturage somewhat earlier in the spring than most forage crops.
In the North, with the exception of the extreme northern portion
of the United States, it will furnish a cutting of hay in June or
excellent pasturage until that time and a crop of hay or seed in late
summer. In the South two cuttings of hay and a seed crop may be
harvested. After maturing seed the plants die. It is a common
practice in many sections to pasture the crop until about June 10,
when the stock is removed and the plants are permitted to mature
seed. If the plants have not been grazed closely they should be
clipped at this time, so that the seed crop will ripen more evenly.
Sweet clover may be pastured during the entire second season's growth,
provided sufficient stock is kept on the field to prevent the growth
from becoming woody. If the plants become coarse the pasture may
be clipped, leaving an 8-inch stubble, so as to induce a new growth
which will be more palatable. If it is desired to have the pasture
reseed itself stock should be removed at least eight weeks before
heavy frosts are expected, or only sufficient stock should be permitted
to remain on the pasture to keep some of the plants in check.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SWEET_CLOVER_IN_MIXTURES" id="SWEET_CLOVER_IN_MIXTURES">SWEET CLOVER IN MIXTURES.</a></p>


<p>Very little sweet clover thus far has been grown in mixtures with
other crops. A few farmers have sown red clover and sweet clover
together, but such a mixture has no advantage over sweet clover
seeded alone for hay, as sweet clover should be cut at least two Weeks
before the red clover is ready to harvest. Sweet clover is being
seeded to some extent on native prairie sod in the Northwest, where
it is claimed it adds greatly to the value of the native grasses for pasturage.
A thin seeding of sweet clover is often desired in bluegrass
pastures on this account. One of the best pastures in eastern Iowa
consists of a mixture of bluegrass, timothy, and sweet clover. The
Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station recommends a mixture
of Johnson grass and sweet clover. In this mixture the first cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
will consist of almost pure sweet clover, while the second and third
cutting's will be a mixture of those plants. A number of southern
farmer have had good success in seeding sweet clover on Bermuda-grass
sod.</p>

<p>The New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station has obtained
excellent results from a mixture of Dwarf Essex rape and sweet
clover, and also by the addition of soy beans to this mixture. It
was found that by seeding 6 pounds of rape and 10 pounds of sweet
clover per acre an abundance of nutritious pasturage was produced
and that pigs preferred this mixture to alfalfa. When soy beans
were added it was seeded at the rate of 1 bushel of soy beans, 6 pounds
of Dwarf Essex rape, and 18 pounds of sweet clover. The soy beans
were drilled by themselves, and the rape and sweet clover were mixed
and seeded with a press drill. Brood sows made a gain of from
three-fourths to 1 pound a day during July on this mixture without
additional feed and gave unusual evidence of thrift and vigor.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="ERADICATION_OF_SWEET_CLOVER" id="ERADICATION_OF_SWEET_CLOVER">ERADICATION OF SWEET CLOVER.</a></p>


<p>Some farmers hesitate to plant sweet clover on their farms for fear
they will have difficulty in eradicating it when the fields are planted
to other crops. The results obtained annually by hundreds of farmers
are sufficient proof that there is no foundation for such fear; in
fact, farmers are experiencing much difficulty in cutting the first crop
the second season so high that the plants will not be killed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
new crop of sweet clover, unlike that of red clover and alfalfa, must
come from the buds left on the stubble, so when the plants are cut
below these buds they will be killed. As sweet clover is a biennial,
the plants die as soon as the seed crop is produced.</p>

<p>When the first year's growth of sweet clover is to be turned under
for green-manure it is recommended that the field be plowed after
the plants have made some growth the following spring rather
than in the fall of the year of seeding. When the first year's growth
is plowed under the same fall many of the plants will not be entirely
covered, and these will made a vigorous growth the following spring.
When the plowing is delayed until the plants have made some growth
the following spring no trouble will be experienced in eradicating
them. (<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11.</a>)</p>
